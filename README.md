##Three Letter Agency

###What?
A collaborative storytelling game of operatives of an agency going on a mission. From an adrenaline charged spy thriller to a tense CSI investigation via police procedurals or even the fire department.

* **Collaborative** The PCs are the heroes. This is about their story. The GM is there to facilitate that story and make sure things are never dull. But the GM has very limited ability to control the story - that lies with the players.
The players have (collectively) complete control over what the story is about.

* **Storytelling** The heart of the system -though it involves dice, does not involve numbers.  Everything is subjective, driven by the details of the fictional situation and of the protagonists history.
* **Game** Though there are no winners and losers, this is still at its heart a game of chance. The protagonists are doing risky things, and sometimes this does not go their way.  Failure, however, is usually both temporary and more interesting than success.
* **Operatives** Our protagonists are employees or members of an organisation. Working for them, doing roughly what they ask. This provides a frame in which to tell the personal tales of the characters, quickly.
* **A Mission** A task for the agency that employs the PCs. By starting with a mission already established we can keep the story tight - suitable for single session play. All the complex questions of which mission & when are dealt and we can start in motion, with a goal. That doesn’t mean the PCs have to stay on track, stay on mission or even stay in the agency. But they start with momentum.
* **An Agency** From a shadowy cabal to the local police department. An organisation that needs groups of operatives to go out and do risky things.
 * Groups: whatever the agency needs doing, can’t be done by an individual.
 * Go out: the mission happens out there - not on base. Giving the PCs a substantial degree of autonomy. Both to make their own decisions and to have deal with whatever arises on their own.
 * Risky: If it was a certain thing, it wouldn’t be interesting. However, risk doesn’t mean violence (though it is the simplest and most obvious way of increasing tension).  Search and rescue is risky. Criminal investigations risk failure, or wrongful accusation, without necessarily risking life and limb.

Inspirations:

Apocalypse World:
For the core structure of Players roll, GMs don’t. Player failure generates adversity.
For GM moves. The menu of options the GM choses from when the PCs fail.
Best Friends:
For the mechanics of friendship - trust and gentle betrayal.
Dungeon world & On Mighty Thews:
Sp(r)out lore. Codification of the player generation of answers to their characters questions about the world.
Swords Without Master:
For dice that tell us about how, not whether our heroes succeed and fail.
For being thwarted by a revelation of more awesome - not by inability.
Spirit of the Century:
For having a list of questions that frame a campaign or mission
RISUS
Hairdressing as a combat skill.
That anything can be useful, no matter how improbable. And that it is often more interesting.
?????
For the heroic montage of victory?


###Playing the game:

This guide will walk (well, mostly stumble - it is a first draft) you through creating a game of TLA.

The agency our protagonists work for
The Operatives themselves. Their histories and peculiarities.
The mission. What are they doing, where, why, how, when, who?
Action!
How characters take action, and what the outcomes are
How the world reacts, the GMs role.

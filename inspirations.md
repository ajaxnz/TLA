# Inspirations

* Apocalypse World:
 * For the core structure of Players roll, GMs donâ€™t. Player failure generates adversity.
 * For GM moves. The menu of options the GM choses from when the PCs fail.
* Best Friends:
 * For the mechanics of friendship - trust and gentle betrayal.
* Dungeon world & On Mighty Thews:
 * Sp(r)out lore. Codification of the player generation of answers to their characters questions about the world.
* Swords Without Master:
 * For dice that tell us about how, not whether our heroes succeed and fail.
 * For being thwarted by a revelation of more awesome - not by inability.
* Spirit of the Century:
 * For having a list of questions that frame a campaign or mission
* RISUS
 * Hairdressing as a combat skill.
 * That anything can be useful, no matter how improbable. And that it is often more interesting.
* ?????
 * For the heroic montage of victory?

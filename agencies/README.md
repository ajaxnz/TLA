# Agencies

The type of story that we will tell is largely determined by the Agency our protagonists work for. The local fire department won’t be sent on high octane stories of international espionage, and if international super-spies are rescuing Granny Wetherwax’s kitten from a tree, there had better be terrorists or russians involved.

The core outcome of building an agency is working out what a typical mission involves, and what typical operatives are like.  Whilst a-typical missions and misfit heroes are great fodder for interesting stories, they only work because of their contrast with our expectations.

To answer these, discuss these topics as a group:

* What is the purpose of the agency?
* What is the scope? How high the stakes?
 * A shootout at a mall is an enormous, climactic event for a CSI. It might be a low risk, comedy interlude for superspies.
 * What kinds of trouble can the PCs ignore?
 * What kind of opponents do you have?
* What genre is this?
 * What genre tropes are expected? Encouraged or banned?
 * Cliches are a double edged sword - often a short-hand that allows things to keep moving, but also a danger of repetition and blandness.
* Why does it have a team of field operatives? (if it doesn’t then it doesn’t need PCs!)
 * What backgrounds are common in its agents?
 * What skills must be present in the team?
 * What can every agent deal with as a matter of course?
* Missions?
 * What do you know at the start?
 * What do the players know that the characters do not
 * When do you know they are finished?




Two worked examples:

ISIS (of Archer fame)
Purpose: crazy spy games. usually fetch quests with insanity.
Scope: Global.  Cut between cities & countries.  Machine-guns are fun. Rocket launchers hurt. Enemies are gangs and agencies, often led by named, scary individuals.
Genre:  Spy-farce.
Operatives:  Insane hero, Professional, Tech/driver, Mad scientist.  Joy-riding millionare, connected mastermind,
Missions.  An objective, a location, an opponent, another interested party. When you are on the way home.
CSI <insert city name>.
Purpose. Solve crimes, usually murder.
Scope. A city. Death happens, but is important.  Getting shot hurts - a lot. Opponents are individual or small groups (2-5).
Genre:  Investigative drama. Chase the trail of clues to the inevitable reveal.
Why a field team?  Cos you chase a case till its done.
Missions: a dead body. Who, who by, why, where, when. All revealed on the way through from a cast of possibilities.  When the criminal inevitably confesses.

# Operatives

In a long running series characters have the chance to acquire depth, to grow quirks & history. Since its a one off (or short series), we have to fake it.

A character consists of 4 things:

0.   Their name
Their current role.   ‘I am <name>, the <role>.
A previous role.  ‘I used to be a <previous role>
Something else they do. ‘When I’m not here, I <other thing>’
Something relevant to this mission - created as part of th emission.

Traits should broad, but not too broad (the most useless piece of advice ever…)
Look to the list of roles thought up as part of the Agency. A primary role should be one of them, and the past and others should be of similar scale.  Its all relative though - a CSI organisation would have all sorts of police specialties, but ‘military’ is one thing. Where-as a military spec ops team would have lots of military detail and ‘police’ as one trait.

Whilst there is often a temptation to make the ‘something else’ throwaway - it should dhave some relevance. To some extent it will build that itself, by turning up. But think on how you will make it relevant in a typical mission.  Flower arranging is a serious creative challenge…
